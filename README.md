This project is about a recipes website.
I learned to set up a main page (index) and separate folders for the single recipes and the relative images.
I learned how to add links in the index to separate pages.
I learned how to create a single recipe page with a few headings, ordered and unordered lists, images with alt descriptions.
I learned how to use git add, git commit (with comments) and git push.
